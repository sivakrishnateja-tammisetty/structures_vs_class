SIMILARITES B/W STRUCT AND CLASS:
            .Both structure and class are used to define our own datatypes.

DIFFERENCES:
            .Structs are of value types(everything in struct are represented by values).
            .struct and struct values are allocated in stack memory.
            .If you want construtor in struct,complusary you need define parameterized constructor only,no default constructor.
            .struct can't have inheritance concept.
            .In struct everything as public.


            .class are reference type(run as a reference type order).
            .In class all are stored in heap memory.
            .In class we define various constructors.
            .class can have inheritance concept.
            .class have hide features(private and public).
